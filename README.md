# Seat Reservation App

## For using MercadoPago you need to unzip the file "Prueba-Mercado-Pago"
## open it up in a new VSCode tab, then on the terminal, open "server",
## open "node", and follow instructions.

### First npm install, to install all the dependencies of the project then npm start.

#### Once done that, you'll have functional the "MercadoPago" button on the main page "seat-reservation-app"

##### Thank you for seeing my project!
